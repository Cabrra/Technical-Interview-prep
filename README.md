Technical Interviews
=====================

## Overview

- Bit Array
	+ A midterm we had during the game development degree. We had two hour to complete the following functionality.
	+ TO-DO:
		+ Init –creates array large enough to hold all bits
		+ Set – turns a specified bit on or off, should only do range checking to prevent crash
		+ Population – finds the number of bits on in the bit array
		+ ClearAll – set all bits to 0
		+ SetAll – set all bits to 1
		+ Copy – copies the passed in bit array


- Matrix Look At
	+ This project was a final programming exam from my degree at Full Sail University. We had 2 hours to complete the test.
	+ TO-DO:
		+ Initialize the matrices for our entities:  the dude, a fancy rug,  and the front door
		+ Have the dude look at the rug, it really ties the room together
		+ The nihilists knock at the door, the dude will then need to turn to door
		+ The dude will then translate forward to answer the knock

- Mixed White Boards
	+ These short programs were implemented in paper to get used to solve programming problems quickly. Note that, all problems have many limitations to simplify and compleet them in 10-20 minutes.
